## 📊 Data Visualizations  
Here are some of the key insights I explored in my Webtoon presentation:  

### 1. **Publishing Trends & Engagement**  
I analyzed Webtoon stories that update **once a week** to determine the best day for publishing based on subscriber counts, views, and likes. The data suggests that **Sunday** is the most popular day, likely due to increased reader activity and the presence of highly engaging stories.  

### 2. **Top Webtoon Stories of 2022**  
Using Power BI, I visualized the top **HOT** stories of 2022. However, due to licensing restrictions, I manually added images for the top 5 stories. The dashboard also features interactive elements—clicking on a story reveals its **synopsis and artwork**, making it easier to explore trending content.  

### 3. **Genres & Recommendation System**  
Webtoon categorizes each story by its **primary genre**, but many stories incorporate multiple themes. The platform’s recommendation system suggests similar stories based on users’ reading habits, encouraging broader engagement.  

### 4. **Author Collaboration & Anonymity**  
Many Webtoon authors use **pen names** to maintain anonymity, possibly for privacy reasons. The **Top Authors Pie Chart** showcases how popular Webtoons are often created through **team collaborations**, ensuring a polished blend of storytelling and artwork.
